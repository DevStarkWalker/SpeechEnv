# Personal Voice Assistant â€“ A Next-Gen Development Tool

## Overview
This project began as a personal endeavor to create a more intelligent and efficient voice assistant, surpassing existing solutions like Siri. It has since evolved into a fully functional development assistant, powered by OpenAI, capable of streamlining workflows and enhancing productivity.

## Features
- **Natural Language Processing**: Enables seamless interaction through voice commands.
- **Code Assistance**: Helps with writing, debugging, and understanding code across various programming languages.
- **Task Automation**: Automates repetitive tasks, making daily development processes more efficient.
- **Contextual Understanding**: Remembers context to offer personalized recommendations and assistance.

## Technologies Used
- **OpenAI API**: Core engine for natural language understanding and task execution.
- **Python**: Main programming language used for backend logic.
- **Speech Recognition**: Converts voice commands to text for processing.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Provides voice responses for interactive feedback.
- **Custom Integrations**: Fine-tuned with additional tools and frameworks to assist with development.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/voice-assistant.git
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
